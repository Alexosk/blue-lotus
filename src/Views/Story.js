          <p className='px-5'>Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. Get tough with it, get strong. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. Even the worst thing we can do here is good.</p>

          <p className='px-5'>Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it.</p>

          <p className='px-5'>Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you. Very easy to work these to death. We must be quiet, soft and gentle. Here we're limited by the time we have.</p>

          <p className='px-5'>It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbersâ€”just to upset the critics. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path.</p>

          <p className='px-5'>In this world, everything can be happy. All you have to learn here is how to have fun. I'm a water fanatic. I love water. Working it up and down, back and forth. We can fix anything.</p>
